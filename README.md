This project is created to meet all the requirements of the assignment given by Agile Cockpit. This projects meets following requirements:-
- Create a shopping item JSON data object for all your items available to make the search happen
- Take the User input from the search form and perform a search on the item JSON data and display the valid search results in the results section
- Have an option to add to the cart and remove from the cart
- Display the items added to the cart
- When clicked on cart it should show the selected items on separate page with a go back button
- On click of go back it should still show the selected items count on cart.
- If add to cart clicked for added item it should increase the count.

The project meets following standards:-
- Code structure 
- Simplicity and ease of understanding the code. 
- Understanding of Angular, HTML, JSON and SCSS. 
- Unit test cases along with coverage (Run command: `ng test --coverage`)
- Use of pre-processor language SCSS for writing styles
